DMemu
==============================

``DMemu`` is a python package implementing nonlinear response of different dark matter extension of :math:`$\Lambda \rm CDM$` model. Using a fitting function or an emulator, a nonlinear :math:`$\Lambda \rm CDM$` matter power spectrum is modified to accommodate a nonlinear matter power spectrum of a specific :math:`$\Lambda \rm CDM$` extension as resulting from gravity-only :math:`$N$`-body simulations. Currently included emulators are two-body decaying dark matter (``TBDemu``).
