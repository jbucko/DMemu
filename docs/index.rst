DMemu
=====

``DMemu`` is a python package implementing nonlinear response of different dark matter extension of :math:`\Lambda \rm CDM` model. Using a fitting function or an emulator, a nonlinear :math:`\Lambda \rm CDM` matter power spectrum is modified to accommodate a nonlinear matter power spectrum of a specific :math:`\Lambda \rm CDM` extension as resulting from gravity-only :math:`N`-body simulations. Currently included emulators are two-body decaying dark matter (``TBDemu``).
