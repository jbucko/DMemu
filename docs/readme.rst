DMemu
==============================

`DMemu` is a python package implementing nonlinear response of different dark matter extension of $\Lambda \rm CDM$ model. Using a fitting function or an emulator, a nonlinear $\Lambda \rm CDM$ matter power spectrum is modified to accommodate a nonlinear matter power spectrum of a specific $\Lambda \rm CDM$ extension as resulting from gravity-only $N$-body simulations. Currently included emulators are two-body decaying dark matter (`TBDemu`).
